# NESPad
 Play NES games on the Novation Launchpad.

Probably the worst way on the planet to play NES games.
Jokes aside, this is a "fully fledged" NES emulator that displays graphics on and gets input from the Novation Launchpad MK2.

Built to work with the NES (and also GameBoy (Color)).
Could probably also work with other cores.

~ This is the definition of MIDI Mario. Take that, Joel.
